# Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning and Deep Learning  

## Project Overview  
This project implements a movie recommendation system using both collaborative and content-based filtering techniques. A neural network model was trained to predict user ratings, and cosine similarity was used for content-based recommendations.  

## Features  
- **Collaborative Filtering with Neural Networks** – Predicts user ratings based on past interactions.  
- **Content-Based Filtering** – Uses cosine similarity to recommend movies with similar characteristics.  
- **High Accuracy** – Achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0015 on movie rating predictions (ratings between 0 and 1).  
- **Hybrid Approach** – Combines deep learning and traditional similarity-based methods for improved recommendations.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- TensorFlow/Keras (Neural Networks)  
- Scikit-Learn (Cosine Similarity)  
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)  

## Learning Outcome  
This project enhanced my understanding of recommendation systems, neural networks, and similarity-based approaches, providing practical experience in building and deploying machine learning models.
